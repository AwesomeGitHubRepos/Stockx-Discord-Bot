# Stockx-Discord-Bot

Stockx Discord Tool that shows product information based on command input.

Command: .sx [keywords here] (no brackets)

It returns an embed with:
- Product Name and StockX link
- Thumbnail Picture
- SKU/PID
- Colorway
- Retail Price
- Release Date (yyyy-mm-dd)
- Highest Bid
- Lowest Ask
- Sales in the last 72 hrs
- Total Pairs Sold

Uses an unofficial Search API that StockX uses to display search results. Same as GOAT. StockX gives more product information though.

You'll need your own discord bot token if you want to test it out.
